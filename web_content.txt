According to a report published by The Economic Times, 83% of India's data-driven companies are more resilient and confident during the pandemic than non-data-driven companies. This shift towards data has created many jobs, with recruiters looking for professionals who can interpret data to help companies adjust to the new reality. With the ever-changing time, industries are also adapting to become more responsive. Today, some leading companies learn to create better roadmaps by predicting what their customers want.

With technologies evolving so rapidly, data is creating enormous opportunities for businesses. It allows them to be more future-ready by altering the building blocks of decisions driven by data, analytics, and technology. In simple terms, data analytics enables businesses to predict outcomes, be agile, and prepare for risks. According to a Gartner report of last year, 33% of large organisations will have analysts practising decision intelligence, including decision modelling, by 2023.

If you are looking for a high-growth career in data analytics, then the 
Applied Business Analytics programme from ISB Executive Education is a must for you. The 12-week programme is designed in collaboration with Eruditus Executive Education to help you explore in-demand ML techniques in business and their applications. No prior coding experience is required, and at the end of the programme, you will gain actionable insights from an industry-oriented curriculum and real-world examples taught via video lectures from top ISB faculty. The programme also includes live online sessions with Eruditus programme leaders.

The Covid-19 pandemic was a significant indicator of how data can give businesses a competitive advantage and can be used to minimise risk, monitor remotely, and ensure preventative and predictive maintenance. According to a report published by The Economic Times, 83% of India's data-driven companies are more resilient and confident during the pandemic than non-data-driven companies. This shift towards data has created many jobs, with recruiters looking for professionals who can interpret data to help companies adjust to the new reality. With the ever-changing time, industries are also adapting to become more responsive. Today, some leading companies learn to create better roadmaps by predicting what their customers want.

With technologies evolving so rapidly, data is creating enormous opportunities for businesses. It allows them to be more future-ready by altering the building blocks of decisions driven by data, analytics, and technology. In simple terms, data analytics enables businesses to predict outcomes, be agile, and prepare for risks. According to a Gartner report of last year, 33% of large organisations will have analysts practising decision intelligence, including decision modelling, by 2023.

If you are looking for a high-growth career in data analytics, then the 
Applied Business Analytics programme from ISB Executive Education is a must for you. The 12-week programme is designed in collaboration with Eruditus Executive Education to help you explore in-demand ML techniques in business and their applications. No prior coding experience is required, and at the end of the programme, you will gain actionable insights from an industry-oriented curriculum and real-world examples taught via video lectures from top ISB faculty.

The Covid-19 pandemic was a significant indicator of how data can give businesses a competitive advantage and can be used to minimise risk, monitor remotely, and ensure preventative and predictive maintenance. According to a report published by The Economic Times, 83% of India's data-driven companies are more resilient and confident during the pandemic than non-data-driven companies. This shift towards data has created many jobs, with recruiters looking for professionals who can interpret data to help companies adjust to the new reality. With the ever-changing time, industries are also adapting to become more responsive. Today, some leading companies learn to create better roadmaps by predicting what their customers want.

With technologies evolving so rapidly, data is creating enormous opportunities for businesses. It allows them to be more future-ready by altering the building blocks of decisions driven by data, analytics, and technology. In simple terms, data analytics enables businesses to predict outcomes, be agile, and prepare for risks. According to a Gartner report of last year, 33% of large organisations will have analysts practising decision intelligence, including decision modelling, by 2023.

If you are looking for a high-growth career in data analytics, then the 
Applied Business Analytics programme from ISB Executive Education is a must for you. The 12-week programme is designed in collaboration with Eruditus Executive Education to help you explore in-demand ML techniques in business and their applications. No prior coding experience is required, and at the end of the programme, you will gain actionable insights from an industry-oriented curriculum and real-world examples taught via video lectures from top ISB faculty.
